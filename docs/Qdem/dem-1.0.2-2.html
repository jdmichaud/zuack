<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Basics on the used client/server architecture</A></H2>

<P>Unlike DOOM and similar games Quake uses a ``server'' process (or even
computer) which ``does'' all the game play. The ``clients'' (at least one)
send to the server all input events (keys, mouse etc.) and receive
all necessary information to draw the current picture. This prevents Quake
from inconsistencies and the network load increases linear with the clients
and not quadratic.</P>
<P>The communication between server and clients is an asynchronous one. 
If you don't
press any key, your computer won't send any packets to the server. But you 
receive from time to time (the network is unpredictable) a packet to describe
the state of your client. It is obvious, that these packets must contain some
time stamp information, the positions of all monsters in sight and some
player state information like the current weapon, ammo etc.</P>
<P> 
And exactly this is the
DEM file format: the recording of all packets from the server to that client,
who recorded the game (the first client). I call these packets 
``blocks of messages'' and the
single information (time, position, ammo etc.) ``message''.</P>
<P>Whether the (listen) server process itself or the
client process does the actual recording (file write access) isn't known but
it is irrelevant for the understanding of the recording process.</P>
