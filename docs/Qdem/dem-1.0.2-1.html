<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Recording and Playback</A></H2>

<P>Recording a game in Quake is as easy as playing it: you need some console
commands to do it well. </P>
<P>To create a single player DEM file start the game as usual and use the console
command <CODE>record name level [cdtrack]</CODE>. This starts <CODE>level</CODE> with
the currently selected skill and writes a record in <CODE>name.dem</CODE>.
The recording will be written during all the play and this record file may 
grow unpredictable. Please make sure that you have some MB free disk space.
To stop this recording use <CODE>stop</CODE> or even quit the whole game 
(<CODE>quit</CODE>). To play it back, use the commands <CODE>playdemo name</CODE>
or <CODE>timedemo name</CODE>. </P>
<P>To create a multi player DEM file start a ``listen'' server 
(recording from a dedicated server doesn't work) and use again the 
<CODE>record</CODE> command. This starts the selected level and the player at the
server is alone in this level. Now all the other clients can connect to the 
server as usual and play what they like (deathmatch or team). The recording 
lasts until the player at the listen server uses the <CODE>disconnect</CODE>, 
<CODE>stop</CODE> or <CODE>quit</CODE> command. The recording is from the point of
view of the player at the listen server (client 1). The playback 
works as in the single player case.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Versions</A></H2>

<P>The documentation covers the following versions of Quake:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>
MS-DOS Shareware <TD>0.91
<TR><TD>
MS-DOS Shareware <TD>0.92
<TR><TD>
MS-DOS Shareware <TD>1.00
<TR><TD>
MS-DOS Shareware <TD>1.01
<TR><TD>
LINUX <TD>0.92
<TR><TD>
</TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

I could not find any important structural differences between these 5 versions.
I actually write and check my documentation with LINUX and verify from time to
time the MS-DOS recordings. </P>
<P>This documentation isn't complete yet. Much decoding work remains to do
(when I find the registered version in the mail) but I think this version 
it will help a lot in the understanding of the DEM format.</P>
